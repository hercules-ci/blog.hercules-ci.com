We've been making good progress since our [October 25th NixCon demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py26iM26Qg4): we are now in a stage where we have started dogfooding!

Some of the things we've built and worked on since NixCon:

 - Realise the derivations and show their status
 - Minimal build logs
 - Keeping track of agent state
 - Improved agent logging
 - Work on Cachix private caches
 - Incorporation
 - Plenty of small fixes, improvements and some open source work

Since we've started dogfooding a few weeks ago, we've been getting valuable insight. There's plenty of things to do and bugs to fix. Once we're happy with the stability, we'll contact subscribers on early adopters list and start handing out access.

Don't forget to fill out the poll if you want to [participate or provide valuable input](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPHH7Y-Kj8YlZHfMVKoNqY1BeoEh2llToN58XsLibVrQwJmQ/viewform)!
