In March 2018 we've set out for a **mission to bring seamless infrastructure for teams using Nix
in day-to-day software development**.

In June 2018 we've [released a solution for developers to easily share binary caches](https://cachix.org/),
today trusted by over a 1000 developers.

In Octobter 2018 we've [shown the very first demo of Hercules CI at NixCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py26iM26Qg4&list=PLgknCdxP89ReJKWX3sthcsbBYsoihzSQX&index=12&t=137s).

In March 2019 we've [added support for private binary caches](https://blog.hercules-ci.com/cachix/nix/2019/03/07/announcing-private-cachix/).

Since April 2019 we've been gradually giving out early access to preview phase with over **100 participating developers**.

## Today 


We are **announcing general availability of continuous integration specialized for Nix projects.**

[Start building and testing your projects](https://hercules-ci.com/dashboard).

## Going forward

In the next months we're going to work closely with customers to polish the experience, continue saving developer's time.
