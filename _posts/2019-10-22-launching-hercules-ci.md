In March 2018 we set ourselves a **mission to provide seamless infrastructure to teams using Nix
in day-to-day software development**.

In June 2018 we [released a solution for developers to easily share binary caches](https://cachix.org/),
trusted today by over a thousand developers.

In Octobter 2018 we [showed the very first demo of Hercules CI at NixCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py26iM26Qg4&list=PLgknCdxP89ReJKWX3sthcsbBYsoihzSQX&index=12&t=137s).

In March 2019 we added [added support for private binary caches](https://blog.hercules-ci.com/cachix/nix/2019/03/07/announcing-private-cachix/).

Since April 2019 we have been gradually giving out early access to the preview release with over **a hundred participating developers**.

## Today


We are **announcing general availability of continuous integration specialized for Nix projects.**

[Check out the landing page to get started](https://hercules-ci.com).

## Going forward

In the coming months we're going to work closely with customers to polish the experience and continue to save developer's time.

For **support** (with getting started and other questions),
contact me at [domen@hercules-ci.com](mailto:domen@hercules-ci.com) so we can set you up
and make sure you get the most out of our CI.
