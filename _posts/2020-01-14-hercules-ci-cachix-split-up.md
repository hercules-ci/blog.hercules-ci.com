After careful consideration of how to balance between the two products, we've decided to split up. Each of the two products will be a separate entity:

- Robert Hensing dedicated to Hercules CI owned by Ensius B.V.
- Domen Kožar dedicated to Cachix owned by Enlambda OÜ

On customer side there will be no changes, except for point of contact in support requests.

Domen & Robert
